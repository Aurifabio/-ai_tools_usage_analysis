## 📊 AI Tools Usage Among High School Students — Data Analysis Project
Source: Kaggle Dataset

This project presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of global high school students' usage of AI tools. With the growing integration of AI technologies into everyday life, understanding how young students engage with these tools is crucial for assessing the educational impact and future trends in technology adoption.

### 🎯 Project Objectives
The goal of this project is to explore the dataset and answer key questions such as:

✅ What is the overall familiarity level of students with AI?
✅ What are the most common purposes for using AI?
✅ Are there differences by country, gender, or grade level?
✅ Which AI tools are considered most useful?
✅ How is the impact of AI perceived by students?

### ✨ Dataset Overview
Global survey of high school students

Includes demographic information (age, gender, country, grade)

Usage indicators for several popular AI tools

Subjective ratings of usefulness for each AI tool

### 📊 Analysis Highlights
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib

Visualizations covering:
✅ AI usage by gender and country
✅ Proportion of students using AI tools by grade
✅ Perceived usefulness of AI tools (e.g., Notion AI, ChatGPT, Grammarly)
✅ Correlation analysis of numerical features

Insights into patterns of adoption, perceived usefulness, and demographic differences

```
Install the required libraries:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Run the Jupyter Notebook:
```
jupyter lab
```
### 💡 Technologies Used
- Python 3.x

- Pandas

- Matplotlib

- Seaborn

- Jupyter Lab

### 📈 Key Findings
✅ Students who report being familiar with AI are more likely to use it for academic purposes
✅ The UK showed higher rates of AI tool adoption among students
✅ Notion AI and ChatGPT are the most frequently used AI tools
✅ The perceived impact of AI is generally positive among the majority of surveyed students
✅ 9th grade students reported the highest AI usage rate

### 🚀 Future Improvements
More advanced statistical modeling (regression, hypothesis testing)

Additional visualizations for deeper insights

Expanded focus on AI's perceived impact versus actual usage patterns

Potential dashboard creation for interactive data exploration
